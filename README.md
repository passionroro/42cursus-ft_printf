# ft_printf
This project is clear and efficient. You have to recode printf. You will then be able to reuse it in your future projects. This project is mainly about variable size arguments. 

## Try it!
First, use `git` to clone my libft into the directory of your choice. 
`	git clone https://github.com/passionroro/42lausanne.git`

Next, `cd` (_change directory_) into 42lausanne/01/ft_printf.
    `cd 42lausanne/00/ft_printf`
  
You can now : 
 - compile all .c the files :
 `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra *.c`
 - make your own tests :
	 - open `vi ft_printf.c`
	 - in the main(), you can see the tests I run. These will compare my ft_printf out vs. what the real printf output.
	 - you may copy/paste the main() into your own ft_printf.c (don't forget `#include <stdio.h>`)
- to execute the program, run `./a.out`
 

>If you are a 42 student, please, run your own tests before trying a third party tester!!!
>During the exam, you won't have much feedback, and you won't have access to any testers, so practice making quick and efficient tests by your self !
>Your ft_printf should behave exactly like the real printf. Be careful to the return value : you should return the number of characters you write !

Enjoy!
